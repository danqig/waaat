## Free Free Play (unstructured)
### Go out and play, but mean it
+ An interesting discussion of unstructured play
+ Recognized benefits of play, concerning problem solving and social skills, creativity, and a protection from technology
+ In this setting, a child's happiness is less important than the goals of the teacher or therapist. Play has been seen as a child's "work". Joy only comes when children are allowed to take play in their own direction.

> There is ample evidence to support Neil Postman's (1982, p. 129) claims that children now have fewer chances to make up their own games and that they are more often goaded into playing for “some external purpose, such as renown, money, physical conditioning, upward mobility, [or] national pride.”

+ **play as source of enrichment and play just for the sake of play?**
+  Eight frames that shape children's play today
  - Achievement (free play serves for a goal/purpose)

  >Even a short recess “makes kids more focused, less fidgety and less disruptive,” said a child development specialist (Tyre, 2006). Play is “a reboot that allows you to absorb new information more fully, grasp more concepts and absorb them,” stressed a Philadelphia pediatrician

  - (Remain) Authority (kids need a guide)

  > These experts focused on the play's educational value, rather than thinking of play as an “interlude"

  > We can’t be there to navigate them all for our kids. If we give them the right tools, they will eventually become strong navigators of their own lives

  > Journalists and commentators suggest that if children do not achieve “ownership” of play, respect its structure and behave, they will instantly become unruly and start fighting. Kids can play, but teachers must remain in control of the “much-needed reprieve” (Douban, 2006, p. 1A). Their authority cannot be questioned; kids cannot just go off and play on their own.

  - A bygone era (a long gone period)

  > “Unstructured play, it seems, is often a romanticized thing of the past,” wrote a Minnesota reporter

  > “the nostalgia was almost palpable–as was the sense of loss these adults felt on behalf of kids who don’t have regular access to small, wild places of mystery and discovery”

  > Parents and kids interviewed by reporters often treated play as if it was obsolete, or that kids, enrapt by video games and exhausted by organized activities, are just not interested in playing (Azizian, 2008, p. E1). To inspire their kids, parents had to be reacquainted with the games they played as kids. Parenting magazines ran articles on how to play children's games and climb trees

  - Containment (a safety concern)

  > Free play can occur, but only if children are contained within clearly drawn physical boundaries

  > No longer is it possible to let kids grab their bikes and explore their surroundings, as one parent explained. “We fear for the safety of our kids and keep them much closer,” she said. She and her husband now plan the bike rides they take with their son as well as “backyard games of football and baseball.”

  > But it does not take large parcels of land to maximize such a program's effectiveness. “We really need to find a way to do it in yards, in parks and in schoolyards,”

  - Crisis (hazards of the absence of free play)

  > to encourage classroom excellence in their children so as to not “fall behind in the race for Harvard”

  > Journalists cited concerns of doctors and psychologists that the absence of free play may contribute to increased stress in children that manifests itself in depression, self-mutilation, eating disorders, and suicide

  - Movement (make it to a movement)

  > What is needed is a “national grassroots movement” that “has arisen in response” to the lack of contact with the environment

  > Activists have also banded together to persuade more schools (O’Connor, 2010, p. A1) to reinstate recess. Angry parents also came together to try and stop officials in East Providence, Rhode Island from replacing 10 daily minutes of unstructured time allotted to students with a 15-min teacher-led recess.

  - Organization (make room for free play)

  > Journalists and commentators asserted that free play should not be allowed to happen spontaneously; it must be managed by experts and carefully inserted by parents into the still busy schedules of children.

  > “we need to begin structuring unstructured, what I call agenda free time for our kids”

  - Peter Pan (a throwback of parents' youth)

  >  People all over the city were “recapturing their youth with kickball, dodge ball, and other playground favorites.”

+ The eight frames identified and refined during the analysis do not ask readers to think of play as an activity undertaken – by kids or by adults revisiting their youth – just for fun.

+ Further, play is described by journalists from the parent's perspective. They control play. Play is rarely seen through the eyes of a child, as Postman argued. And when it is, the child plays under a parent's watchful eyes, eyes that have seen the harm that could befall a “free range” child allowed to wander.

+ children and their parents must relearn play, as if over scheduling has wiped out their ability to make up games on their own

**In the end, mainstream journalists have presented their readers and viewers with a narrowly told story of play. Adults during the last decade have embraced play, advocated for play, built new spaces for play, but are far from comfortable permitting actual independent play to happen**

> it is hoped that this study's results will cause journalists to consider presenting play as far more than something that will improve a child's chances of getting into a good college or as an overly romanticized activity co-opted by adults wanting to recapture or prolong their youth
